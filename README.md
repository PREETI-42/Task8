This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The data is standardized for consistent scaling, and the Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is then validated using the Silhouette Score. The script visualizes customer segments and centroids, providing insights into spending behavior patterns. Additionally, PCA is implemented for dimensionality reduction when using higher-dimensional data, allowing for effective 2D visualizations. This clustering approach helps in targeted marketing strategies and understanding customer groups more effectively.
